# Security Engineering Exploits

The King's College London Security Engineering coursework encompasses 10 challenges (lev1 to lev10), each increasing in difficulty and residing in its directory on the virtual machine at /var/challenge/levelX. In each directory, there is a vulnerable program with its corresponding source code. Starting with lev0 access, the objective is to exploit each challenge to progress to the next level. Successful exploitation should lead to the execution of the special command "l33t" (full path: /usr/local/bin/l33t). Upon executing "l33t" with the correct privileges, a confirmation message will be received, indicating an elevation in access privileges (added to a higher group).

## Level 01
The level 01 program is an authentication mechanism designed to grant access to a shell only if the contents of two specified files are identical. The comparison is performed using the "diff" command, which typically compares the contents of two files and outputs the differences.

```bash
status = system("/usr/bin/diff /var/challenge/level1/.secret ~/.secret > /dev/null");
```
In the vulnerable code segment, it uses the `system` function to execute the `diff` command.

* `/usr/bin/diff`: The path to the "diff" command, responsible for comparing files.
* `/var/challenge/level1/.secret`: The path to the first file, located in the system's challenge directory.
* `~/.secret`: The second file's path, where the tilde (~) is intended to represent the user's home directory.

### Level 01 Vulnerablity
The vulnerability stems from the program's reliance on the tilde symbol, where malicious actors can exploit this trust to redirect the file comparison towards unintended files, potentially within their control. This manipulation introduces an `environment attack vulnerability`, enabling unauthorized access and facilitating privilege escalation.
